Cat_vs_Yarn
===========
To run the game in Windows, double click on "Cat_vs_Yarn.exe".
The file "cat_vs_yarn.py" contains the pygame code used to create the game.
The super Mario background was downloaded from a google image search while the frames for the player, cat fish and yarn 
I drew in inkscape. 
While running the game might ocassionally freeze while the "long_johnson.mp3" file is playing.
